Welcome to Molloy Eats!

This is a demo food ordering app/website with the ability to order items from several restaurants affliated with Molloy College.
You can create an account and user information is then stored in a SQL database. Uses JSON web token for token authentication.
Front-end is constructed using React and HTML while Back-End is an Express Server which uses Apollo/GraphQL to communicate with 
a PostgresSQL database.

This was a project created for the Capstone Seminar class at Molloy College.
